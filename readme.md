### Generate SVG Symbols

`./svg-source/` is where you put standalone sag source files which created by your awesome designer.

`./app/images/icon-svg-symbol.svg` is the default generated file.

You can change these settings by editing `./generate-svg-symbols.js`.

Run the following command:

```
node ./generate-svg-symbols.js
```
